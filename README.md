2d Platformer in Unity


still in progress. Learning tutorial from Brackeys: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR42oVBU6K2DIL6Y22Ry9J1c

This is the best tutorial i have done so far. Making me realize that my math teachers werent full of baloney was surprising to say the least. Using graph algorithms to aim with the mouse was the most surprising part. I am amazed at how it works so well. Simplistic implementation. The parallaxing is another thing that i was interested in seeing. Being a former compositor, i wanted to see how you could do it through code. Again simplistic implementation, just a little rough for my tastes.
